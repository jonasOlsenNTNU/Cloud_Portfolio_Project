        -Description: Terraform CLI installation required to run Terraform commands.

        -Description: AWS CLI installed to provision Terraform CLI with AWS credentials.

Important info about first time setup:

1. Comment out backend declaration in main.tf the first time the template is applied.
    -In order to use the S3 bucket + DynamoDB table for version-controlling the Terraform Template
    it must first be created by the template. Including backend on the first application of the template
    throws an error message.
2. A webapp task is created for the cluster in order to initialize the service, but there are no images in the
    ECR repo when initialized. Use the CD workflow on GitHub to push the image after applying this template.
